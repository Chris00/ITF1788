imports:

#
# Tokens used for proper indentation.
# The ITF supports three levels of indentation:
#   - the basic level where imports are inserted
#   - a second level where testcases start
#   - a third level where assert statements are inserted
#
# The token "spaces_indent" specifies the number of whitespace
# charakters a block shall be indented as a natural number.
# The tokens "indent_testcases" and "indent_tests" may be either
# "true" or "false", depending on whether or not these blocks
# shall be indented or not.
