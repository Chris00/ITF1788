# assert (X, Y) does not work with custom types
# assert (X == Y) may fail when comparing decorated intervals with bare intervals, see bug #42735
# assert (eq (X, Y)) fails if X and Y are strings of different length
# assert (all (eq (X, Y))) would throw a warning and does not abort when comparing decorated interval with bare intervals (implicit promotion of bare intervals)
# assert (isequal (X, Y)) fails for interval matrices, see bug #44334, but that's not a problem because ITF1788 does not support interval matrices
